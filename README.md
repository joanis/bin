# ~/bin

Storing here a part of my bin directory.

### Tools

#### ascii
Got tired of searching Google for ASCII tables. Calling it with no parameter shows a table of 7-bit ASCII. (Ruby)

Three parameter formats are accepted to get information about a specific character:
- 0x##: an hexadecimal ASCII value
- 0d##: a decimal ASCII value
- x: a single ASCII character

#### md5diff
Directory diff utility. (Perl, md5sum)

#### svn-hist
SVN file history retriever. Shows all diffs for a file. Not from me, but still sometimes very handy. (Bash, svn)
